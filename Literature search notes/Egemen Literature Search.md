I used Estlcam to generate the toolpaths as it can generate
Marlin compatible gcode and again, its free and easy to use.

I switched from Estlcam to Inventables Easel as its free and
extremely easy to use, much simpler than anything else I've used so far.



I also switched to something thatâ€™s designed to run a CNC,
the openbuilds control software. Again this is free and easy to use.

Oh and you can control your machine with your phone too
which is pretty cool.
